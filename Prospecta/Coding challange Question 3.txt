while creating api you should be carefull about the following things;
1.There should be proper handling of checked/unchecked exceptions .
2. All the classes should have proper annotations so that the beans will get registered with the container and 
3, beans should get injected whereever required into the dependent class.
4. all the api's should work proper , global Exception handler should be there 
5. No one should be able to access the api where there is security used .
6. should have simplicity.
7. Security for the users:Authenticate and authorize users: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the API.
Validate input: Validate all input to the API to ensure that it is in the expected format and does not contain any malicious content.
8 Use of DTOs should be there 
9. No one should be able to get the private information through the database .
10.Handle API errors gracefully: Make sure to handle API errors gracefully to ensure that the application does not crash or behave unexpectedly.
