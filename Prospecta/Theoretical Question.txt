Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.

A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3

1. Tackling the challenge 
	
	firstly I'll take input from the file using buffered reader (java.io package) and then using 
	readLine(); i will take it as a string

	->String data = br.readLine();

	then will split that 
	->String [] arr = data.split(",");
	
	have a hashMap to store it;
	after spliting i will run a loop on arr (variable) then  
	
	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	
	//in this loop i'll again split it by(":");
	splitVar = arr[i].split(":");
	now, splitVar[0] will be A1 or B1 etc and
	 splitVar[1] will have the value or the formula
	so before sending it to hashmap
	
	i will check the that if splitVar[1].contains("=") 
	and then i will calculate it using some Evaluate dependency which will evaluate it for me 
	or in this this case there is only sum so after getting '=' in the string 
	i will use substring and remove "="  , then i will  again split it with "+" sign and
	check that which one is having a variable if there is a variable i will check it in the 
	hashmap if its already there or not , if its not there than definetly there will be a error.
	other wise i will get the value and sum the output and store it in the hashmap
	
	}

2. Errors that can occur
	a. First error will be in the formula that can occur , suppose if already there is data which
	is not entered in to hashmap , so how it will calculate the variable which is not available for us
	 to use right now.
	
	b. Second error can when there is no value passed , and null pointer exception could be
	there.
	
	c. File could be corrupted or number format exception could be there.

3. Break the code:
	user can break the code in to three parts i.e.
	1. splitting it with commas
	2.storing key(A1,A2,etc) and value(Numbers only) in to the hashmap, but if the formula given wasn't solve then the code will not work;
	3.then checking it in the hashmap if it contains key then performing the action accordingly
	4.If I'll be using dependency to evaluate the formula then there would be less chances of errors after using substring to remove "=" sign
	5. then storing in to the hashmap.
	6. Attempting to reference cells that do not exist in the input
	7.Providing formulas with syntax errors
	8.division by zero or other illegal operations.
