Spring MVC is a framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It is a part of the Spring Framework and is 
built on top of the Spring IoC container.

In Spring MVC, the "Model" represents the data and business logic of the application, the "View" represents the user interface, and the "Controller" is responsible 
for handling input and forwarding it to the appropriate Model or View.

The basic flow of a Spring MVC application is as follows:

A user sends an HTTP request to the web server.
The DispatcherServlet (the front controller) receives the request and routes it to the appropriate controller.
The controller handles the request and invokes the appropriate service(s) to process the request.
The service(s) update the model data and return it to the controller.
The controller selects the appropriate view to render the model data and returns the view name to the DispatcherServlet.
The DispatcherServlet forwards the request to the selected view, which renders the final HTML output to the user.

Spring MVC provides a lot of flexibility and extensibility, allowing developers to easily customize various aspects of the framework to suit the specific
needs of their application
