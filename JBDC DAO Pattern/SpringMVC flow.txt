Spring MVC is a framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It is part of the Spring framework, which is a popular Java-based framework for building enterprise applications. Spring MVC provides a powerful and flexible way to build web applications, and it is widely used for building web applications of all sizes and complexity.

The MVC pattern separates the application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.

The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for holding and manipulating the data, and it is typically implemented
using Java objects.

The View represents the user interface of the application. It is responsible for displaying the data to the user and for handling user input. It is typically implemented using JSP, Thymeleaf or other template engine.

The Controller is responsible for handling user requests and directing them to the appropriate view. It is typically implemented using a Java class annotated with @Controller.

Spring MVC provides a powerful and flexible way to implement the MVC pattern by providing a set of annotations and interfaces that make it easy to define the model, the view, and the controller. It also provides a powerful framework for handling requests, validating input, and handling errors. Additionally, it provides support
for a wide variety of view technologies, including JSP, Thymeleaf, and others.

Spring MVC is a framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It is a part of the Spring Framework and is 
built on top of the Spring IoC container.

In Spring MVC, the "Model" represents the data and business logic of the application, the "View" represents the user interface, and the "Controller" is responsible 
for handling input and forwarding it to the appropriate Model or View.

The basic flow of a Spring MVC application is as follows:

A user sends an HTTP request to the web server.
The DispatcherServlet (the front controller) receives the request and routes it to the appropriate controller.
The controller handles the request and invokes the appropriate service(s) to process the request.
The service(s) update the model data and return it to the controller.
The controller selects the appropriate view to render the model data and returns the view name to the DispatcherServlet.
The DispatcherServlet forwards the request to the selected view, which renders the final HTML output to the user.

Spring MVC provides a lot of flexibility and extensibility, allowing developers to easily customize various aspects of the framework to suit the specific
needs of their application



*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If you are using Postman to test a Spring MVC application, the flow will be as follows:

You will open the Postman application and set the request type to the appropriate HTTP verb (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
You will set the request URL to the appropriate endpoint of your Spring MVC application.
You may add any necessary headers and request body to the request.
You will then send the request to the server by clicking the "Send" button.
The request will be received by the DispatcherServlet (front controller) of the Spring MVC application.
The DispatcherServlet will route the request to the appropriate controller based on the URL and the HTTP verb.
The controller will handle the request, invoke the appropriate service(s) to process the request and update the model data.
The controller will select the appropriate view to render the model data and return the view name to the DispatcherServlet.
The DispatcherServlet will forward the request to the selected view.
The view will render the final output, and the response will be sent back to Postman.
In Postman, you can see the response including the status code, headers and response body.
It's worth noting that you may see different behavior if your application has security mechanism like JWT and other, you may need to pass additional 
headers or cookies to authenticate your request.
